        <h1>Spaceship navigation systems</h1>
        <p>The first step for navigating in space is understanding which way you are pointed. The Space Shuttle had opticalsensors that could orient using the stars, and in case of computer failure astronauts also needed to know how to navigate visually using the stars. By marking the ship’s position relative to stars using a tiny telescope, astronauts could build a three-dimensional reference frame that told them which way the ship was pointing in space.</p>
        <p>The next key part of navigation is where you are relative to Earth. Astronauts use a combination of visual techniques and instruments to figure this out. Earth’s magnetic field can be used to help determine north and south. Altitude can be estimated by measuringthe amount of drag of the upper atmosphere around you. Large antennas on the ground precisely track the ship and send it position and speed data. GPS gives not just position and speed, but multiple GPS receivers on the ship can be compared to determine orientation too. Gyroscopes and accelerometers on board keep track of movement.</p>
        <p>On board the Russian Soyuz capsule, the crew uses a mirrored periscope to visually line the ship up exactly with the horizon of Earth, firing thrusters to also turn it to parallel motion across the ground. Once aligned like this, the gyroscopes and accelerometers know the ship’s orientation relative to Earth. Thus the computers and the crew know which way they are pointing at all times, and can accurately fire engines as needed.</p>
        <p>The combination of all of the readings from various instruments helps create what is called a ship’s state vector, which is a measurement that tells you precisely where you are and exactly where you’re going. This is especially critical when you consider the enormous speeds and lack of standard navigation references for a spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Future missions to the Moon and Mars will use a similar combination of visual navigation tools and instruments. For a human mission to Mars, this could even include use of Mars’s two moons and the faint magnetic field still emanating from the surface rock of Mars.</p>
