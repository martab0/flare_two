        <p>Space stations enable us to experience and take advantage of spaceflight over long periods of time. Chris describes them as “purpose-built laboratories orbiting the world.” Their unique environment allows us to conduct experiments that aren’t possible on Earth—directly observing the universe and our planet with multiple sensor types, and using the unending, near-perfect vacum and microgravity environment for research and manufacture. They are also a test bed for spaceship hardware, to gain proven experience and confidence close to home before we head farther into the solar system.</p>
        <p>The Soviets built the first space station, Salyut 1, in the early 1970s, and launched steadily improved versions of it through Salyut 7 in 1982. NASA’s first space station, Skylab, was in orbit from 1973–79. It was built using the heavy lift capabilities of the Saturn V rocket. The first segment of the Russian space station Mir was launched in 1986, and additional segments were sent using Proton rockets and the NASA Space Shuttle until Mir’s deorbit in 2001. (Chris and his crew built the Shuttle Docking Module onto Mir in 1995.) The International Space Station, the world’s largest structure ever in space, began assembly in orbit in 1998, and has had crews aboard continuously since 2000. With 15 countries cooperating on a daily basis to operate it, the lessons learned have been political as well as operational, technical, and scientific. ISS was designed for 30 years of life, through 2028, when the cost of maintenance is expected to start becoming prohibitive. At that time, to avoid an unplanned orbital decay and random impact with Earth somewhere, it will be deliberately driven into the empty expanse of the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>The ISS was constructed and assembled module by module. The size of each module was limited by the place and way in which they were launched to space—for example, by the dimensions of the payyload bay of the Space Shuttle, or the height of the railway overpasses between Moscow and the Russian launch site in Baikonur, Kazakhstan. The ISS central modules are pressurized habitats where the crew lives and works, while the main transverse truss supports power, cooling, communications, external stowage, and scientific test equipment.</p>
        <p>The ISS is electrically powered using solar arrays that rotate to track the Sun throughout each orbit. Waste heat is gathered by cooling loops inside the ship and expelled out into space through large, flat radiators. The ISS is primarily flown in an orientation known as LVLH, which stands for “local vertical, local horizontal,” such that the “bottom” of the ISS faces Earth and the “nose” is pointed into the velocity vector (the direction it’s moving).</p>
        <p>There are multiple docking ports on the ISS to allow for different types of spacecraft to dock, including the Space Shuttle, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, planned human-rated capsules, and various resupply craft. The specific docking mechanisms vary from port to port.</p>
        <p>The Canadian-built robotic manipulators Canadarm (Shuttle-based) and Canadarm2 (ISS-based) helped assemble, grow, and repair the ISS. The ISS also has a two-armed dexterous robot called Dextre for delicate work outside, and a Japanese-built robotic arm for deploying experiments externally.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of experiments running on the ISS simultaneously, including those sponsored by governments, space agencies, universities, and private companies. The eventual intent is that the cost of launching and operating a space station will become low enough that they can be purely commercial platforms.</p>
