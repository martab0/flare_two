        <h1>The ISS: life support system</h1>

        <p>Astronauts live aboard the ISS using a combination of supplies brought up from Earth, including oxygen and water, and onboard technology that regenerates them. To explore further into space, we’ll need to develop reliable equipment that will allow us to eventually wean ourselves from Earth resupply entirely.</p>
        <p>Much of what the life support equipment does on the ISS mimics what happens naturally on Earth. Processors purify the astronauts’ air, filtering trace gases and removing their exhaled carbon dioxide. Whre possible, the oxygen is extracted and released back into the cabin, but the small losses are supplemented with stored oxygen. Water is similarly recycled from urine and dehumidifiers, typically with about 90 percent efficiency. That’s better than ever, but every cargo ship still carries air and water to the ISS—we need to get to virtually 100 percent recycling before we can venture with confidence to Mars.</p>
        <p>Food is even more difficult to recycle. As farming is a multistage process, growing seasons take time. A balanced diet is essential. For simplicity and reliability, the ISS receives virtually all of the astronauts’ food via regular deliveries from Earth. To ensure long shelf life and to minimize the chance of food poisoning, meals are dehydrated, irradiated, thermo-stabilized and/or canned. Preparation is kept simple, with a water dispenser and warming ovens. Only rarely, as a kindness from the support team, can a few items of fresh fruit or vegetables be sent to the crew, added as late stowage on a resupply ship.</p>
        <p>For missions frther into space, bringing prepared food will become less practical. There are currently experiments on the Space Station to explore how to grow crops, testing things such as what direction a plant grows without gravity, how to pollinate, and what types of hydroponic soil are best. The ability to grow food while in space is just one of the many needed technologies for missions to Mars and beyond.</p>
        <p>The ISS is thus a test bed for new ideas and technologies, and that includes habitats. On the ISS is a minibus-sized habitable protrusion called BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module). It was launched like a collapsed accordion, installed using Canadarm2, and then extended full size. This could provide an alternative design for future space habitats, as it uses less space during launch—meaning smaller rockets can carry it, which reduces cost.</p>
