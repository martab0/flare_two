        <p>The morning of launch marks the culmination of years of training and the realization of a lifetime of dreams. It’s a day filled with sensory experiences, extreme danger, and elite execution.</p>
        <p>Focus is paramount. Your extensive, realistic preparation makes everything second nature, from waving at the crowd to flying the rocket itself. As the clock counts down to zero, you’re lying on your back, intensely watching the instruments as all the rocket engines ignite. The whole crew could not be more focused. Your entire world comes down to only what is happening on the flight deck of the spaceship. Outside the windows, the light blue sky rapidly gets darker and darker, until it turns black. The ride is intensely physical, with g-forces three times normal and rough, high-frequency vibration as the vehicle shoulders its way through the thick air. After two minutes you’re high enough that the air has thinned to almost nothing, and the first-stage boosters</p>
        <p>explode off in a burst of fireworks.</p>
        <p>Then the ride is suddenly smooth—but steadily getting heavier as the ship burns off fuel and the acceleration grows. The spaceship rolls through 180 degrees to let the communication antennae point at orbiting relay satellites. The ship becomes light enough that you reach 3G, and the computers ease the throttles back to not overstress the vehicle. Each passing second takes you past emergency abort and failure options, and improves your chances of making it to orbit today. And after eight and a half minutes, suddenly the moment you have been dreaming about but never believed would happen has come. The engines shut down and you are safely there, weightless, in space.</p>
        <p>As this class progresses and you learn more about what being an astronaut requires and feels like, remember Chris’s description of leaving Earth. That’s what you’re working toward.</p>
