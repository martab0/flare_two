        <h1>History of humans in space</h1>
        <p>12 April 1961</p>
        <p>Yuri Gagarin was the first human in space and the first in Earth orbit, on Vostok 1.</p>
        <p>17 July 1962 or 19 July 1963</p>
        <p>Either Robert M. White or Joseph A. Walker (depending on the definition of the space border) was the first to pilot a spaceplane, the North American X-15, on 17 July 1962 (White) or 19 July 1963 (Walker).</p>
        <p>18 March 1965</p>
        <p>Alexei Leonov was first to walk in space.</p>
        <p>15 December 1965</p>
        <p>Walter M. Schirra and Tom Stafford were first to perform a space rendezvous, piloting their Gemini 6A spacecraft to achieve station-keeping one foot (30 cm) from Gemini 7 for over 5 hours.</p>
        <p>16 March 1966</p>
        <p>Neil Armstrong and David Scott were first to rendezvous and dock, piloting their Gemini 8 spacecraft to dock with an uncrewed Agena Target Vehicle.</p>
        <p>21–27 December 1968</p>
        <p>Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders were first to travel beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) and first to orbit the Moon, on the Apollo 8 mission, which orbited the Moon ten times before returning to Earth.</p>
        <p>26 May 1969</p>
        <p>Apollo 10 reaches the fastest speed ever traveled by a human: 39,897 km/h (11.08 km/s or 24,791 mph), or roughly 1/27,000 of lightspeed.</p>
        <p>20 July 1969</p>
        <p>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were first to land on the Moon, during Apollo 11.</p>
        <p>14 April 1970</p>
        <p>The crew of Apollo 13 attained pericynthion above the Moon, setting the current record for the highest absolute altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft: 400,171 kilometers (248,655 miles) from Earth.</p>
        <p>Longest time in space</p>
        <p>Valeri Polyakov performed the longest single spaceflight, from 8 January 1994 to 22 March 1995 (437 days, 17 hours, 58 minutes, and 16 seconds). Gennady Padalka has spent the most total time in space on multiple missions, 879 days.</p>
        <p>Longest-duration crewed space station</p>
        <p>The International Space Station has the longest period of continuous human presence in space, 2 November 2000 to present (22 years and 108 days). This record was previously held by Mir, from Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 to the Soyuz TM-29 on 28 August 1999, a span of 3,644 days (almost 10 years).</p>
