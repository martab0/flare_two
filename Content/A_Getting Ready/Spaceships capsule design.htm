        <h1>Spaceships: capsule design</h1>
        <p>The fundamental human needs are air, water, food, and shelter.</p>
        <p>We have evolved on Earth where these are readily available, but to leeave our planet, a spaceship needs to be capable of reliably providing them all. The complexity of this task is exacerbated by weightlessness and the surrounding vacuum: from blood pressure to convection, nothing behaves the same in space as it does on Earth.</p>
        <p>Spaceships have improved since we began traveling to space in the 1960s, but a lot of our current technology originates from those first designs. NASA’s Mercury and Gemini spacecrafts were essentially orbiting cockpits with mechanical systems to keep the crew alive: air pressare regulation, oxygen/CO2 processing, temperature control, and food and water storage. They proved that orbital spaceflight was possible for humans and opened the door to explore further.</p>

        <p>The Apollo program took 12 astronauts to the surface of the Moon and back. The ship was rugged and capable enough that even in the face of a major explosion—such as the one that occurred on Apollo 13, destroying much of the ship’s oxygen supply—the crew made it safely home. A major design constraint on all spaceships is atmospheric reentry. How does the vehicle safely slow down and land, from the initial speed of five miles per second for Mercury/Gemini to the nearly seven miles per second for Apollo?</p>

        <p>Intuitively, it would seem to make sense that a spaceship should be pointy, like a high-speed aircraft. Research done in the 1950s, however, showed that, for orbital speeds, no material could be tough enough to take the tremendous heat on that pointed tip.</p>
        <p>A brilliant engineer named Max Faget realized that reentry spaceships need to be blunt, to spread the intense heat and pressure over a large area. He was key in designing Mercury, and thus the space capsule was born.</p>
        <p>Apollo was more than just a capsulee, however. It also carried the spider-like Lunar Lander, and had a large Service Module that supported the crew to the Moon and back. To regulate the temperature difference between the Sun’s heat on one side and the cold of deep space on the other, the Apollo spacecraft rotated as though on a rotisserie throughout its transit to the Moon.</p>
