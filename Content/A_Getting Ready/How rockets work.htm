        <p>In order to get an object to space, you essentially need the following: fuel and oxygen to burn, aerodynamic surfaces and gimbaling engines to steer, and somewhere for the “hot stuff” to come out to provide enough thrust. Simple.</p>
        <p>Fuel and oxygen are mixed and ignited inside the rocket motor, and then the explding, burning mixture expands and pours out the back of the rocket to create the thrust needed to propel it forward. As opposed to an airplane engine, which operates within the atmosphere and thus can take in air to combine with fuel for its combustion reaction, a rocket needs to be able to operate in the emptiness of space, where there’s no oxygen. Accordingly, rockets have to carry not just fuel, but also their own oxygen supply. When you look at a rocket on a launch pad, most of what you see is simply the propellant tanks—fuel and oxygen—needed to get to space.</p>
        <p>Within the atmosphre, aerodynamic fins can help steer the rocket, like an airplane. Beyond the atmosphere, though, there’s nothing for those fins to push against in the vacuum of space. So rockets also use gimbaling engines—engines that can swing on robotic pivots—to steer. Sort of like balancing a broom in your hand. Another name for this is vectored thrust.</p>
        <p>Rockets are normally built in separate stacked sections, or stages, a concept developed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Russian math teacher, and Robert Goddard, an American engineer/physicist. The operative principle behind rocket stages is that we need a certain amount of thrust to get above the atmosphere, and then further thrust to accelerate to a speed fast enough to stay in orbit around Earth (orbital speed, about five miles per second). It’s easier for a rocket to get to that orbital speed without having to carry the excess weight of empty propellant tanks and early-stage rockets.</p>
        <p>So when the fuel/oxygen for each stage of a rocket is used up, we jettison that stage, and it falls back to Earth. The first stage is primarily used to get the spacecraft above most of the air, to a height of 150,000 feet or more. The second stage then gets the spacecraft to orbital velocity. In the case of the Saturn V, a NASA rocket known as a Heavy Lift Vehicle, there was a third stage, which enabled astronauts to get to the Moon. This third stage had to be able to stop and start, in order to establish the right orbit around Earth, and then, once everything was checked a few hours later, push us to the Moon.</p>

        <p>Even the Lunar Module—which Apollo astronauts used to get to the surface of the Moon and back—was a two-stage rocket. When we launched from the Moon to return home, the landing stage was left on the surface.</p>
        <p>The first rockets that were built were single use, with no thought of reusing them again. The Space Shuttle was the first spacecraft that was designed to be reused, and it was capable of being flown to space one hundred times. Even its solid rocket boosters were partially reusable—they could be recovered after falling into the ocean, salvaged, cleaned and recertified, and refilled with fuel for later launches. Today, companies are building even more reusable</p>
        <p>rockets; SpaceX is able to launch and then land the first stage of its Falcon rocket, recovered intact and ready to be filled again with liquid fuel. Similar technology is also being used by Blue Origin for their New Shepard rocket.</p>
